  <h2>Project Difficulties</h2>
  <p>
    As my first project made for a client, the main problems addressed were project planning, design and mobile responsiveness.

  <h2>Solution</h2>
  <p>
    Building the site was really smooth due to researching exactly what the client wanted the site to do for them and getting a feel for the business' asthetic before designing the site.  I learned a lot about responsive design as well. To me, this project was a test in CSS skills.
