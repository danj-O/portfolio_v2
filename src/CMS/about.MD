Web developer and perpetual learner.  Self-taught programmer who loves to learn new technologies and build interesting things. A semi-professional musician for years, Dan's entry into programming was in 2015, when he configured a Raspberry Pi with Pure Data to be a portable multi-effects unit used on tour through Asia.  It worked great and Dan was hooked on programming and continues building different music related programs.  Since last year, Dan has shifted his focus to web development and has been building sites for local businesses and tirelessly upping his dev game.
