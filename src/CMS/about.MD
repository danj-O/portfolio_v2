# About me

Web developer and perpetual learner.  Self-taught programmer who loves to learn new technologies and build interesting things. Self-taught in many fields outside of web development including Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Pure Data, music performance and production, video editing.  Daniel's entry into the computer world was in middle school when he built his first computer. He took a shine to Web design and development while in high-school, where he became slightly obsessed with Flash(R.I.P.) animation. Years later, after a creative writing degree and 9 years of professional musicianship, Dan has gone full circle back to web development.
