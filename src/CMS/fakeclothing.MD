  <h2>Project Difficulties</h2>
  <p>
    This project was made to learn how to properly set up an e-commerce React app.  The biggest difficulties were wrapping my head around redux and authentication.

  <h2>Solution</h2>
  <p>
    Through many tutorials and lessons, this project was successfully deployed to Heroku.  I have found that Redux can be powerful but seems like a bit too much for a small project.  Redux and Firebase are really important to understand as a web developer and I'm happy I am one step closer to understanding how to properly implement them.  Using Stripe proved to be pretty simple and a great solution to providing secure payments to users.
