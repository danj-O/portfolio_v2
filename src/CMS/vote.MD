  <h2>Project Difficulties</h2>
  <p>
    Make an app for those times when you and your friends have a disagreement about something.  Most of the difficulties for me were in getting values to persist through various scenes of the app and how to take values from an input and put them into a newly created element.  The trickiest part for me was if there was a tie, displaying what options the tie was between.

<div class="par-section">
  <h2>Solution</h2>
  <p>
    As this was my first vanilla JS app made without a tutorial, DOM manipulation and simple algorithms to find the highest polled option and display these options' values was the main problem.  Now, I would have written this project quite differently.
