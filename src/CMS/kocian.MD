  <h2>Project Difficulties</h2>
  <p>
    When starting this project, it was uncertain how big it could get so scaleability was a must.  The client wanted an e-commerce site with a blog that could be maintained by their own staff.  In addition, every product (over 300) needed their own page.  All of these items should be purchasable online.

  <h2>Solution</h2>
  <p>
    After doing some initial research, I found Gatsby to be just about what I needed.  All the site's content is fetched with graphQL from the CMS so the client can edit just about anything without knowing any code.  Because Gatsby statically generates pages, I wrote a template for all items and turned it into a modal so every item would have one no mattter where it was clicked on the site.  I also did all of the product photography for these pages.
